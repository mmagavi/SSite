    Welcome to SSORT! My name is Maya Magavi, and I'm a Sophomore studying computer science at Brown University. I created this system to maximize efficiency for the process of sorting cerebral tissue
    sections for staining and analysis in a pharmaceutical lab.
   </div>
   <div id="txt">
    The old system the lab that I created this for involved a researcher manually transferring each of the sections
    as they were sliced by a machine called a Vibratome into a 24-well plate in a specific pattern. This process was
    evidently very inefficient, and required hours of human labor. My solution completely automates this process, preparing
    the sections for analysis twice as fast and eliminating the need for hours of human labor.
   </div>
   <div id="txt">
    SSORT uses a hydraulic pump system to collect the sections from the Vibratome's bath were they are deposited post-cut.
    A motorized X-Y stage controlled by the BlackBox motion control system ensures that the tubes will deposit the sections
    in the correct well. When the Vibtratome's blade returns to its initial position, a sensor is triggered which sends
    a signal to move to the next well.
